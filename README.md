# Grinding HackerRank, Edabit and CodeWars to Practice Algorithm & Data Structure ðŸ”¥

I'm willing to grind to learn algorithm and data structure.

I picked HackerRank because many companies like to use HackerRank platform to conduct technical assessment and also very popular world wide.

I picked Edabit beacuse it's very UI friendly and I can see other programmers' solution right away. 

I picked CodeWars beacuse various difficulties of problemas and I can see other programmers' solution right away.
