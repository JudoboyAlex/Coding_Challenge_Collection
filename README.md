# Grinding HackerRank and Edabit to Practice Algorithm & Data Structure ðŸ”¥

I have decided to learn algorithm and data structure to become a better programmer.

I picked HackerRank because many companies like to use HackerRank platform to conduct technical assessment and also very popular world wide.

I picked Edabit beacuse it's very UI friendly and I can see other people's solution right away.
